# Tips & Examples Added to RCT Design Wizard

## Overview
Enhanced the RCT Design Wizard with comprehensive tips, prompts, and real-world examples from social development sectors (Education, Health, Agriculture) following the pattern from the original design.

## Changes Made

### 1. Quick Start Guide (Main Page)
Added comprehensive guide at the top with:
- How to use the wizard (5 steps)
- Tips for success (4 key tips)
- Example program contexts from 3 sectors

### 2. Section-Specific Enhancements

#### Section 0: Meta/Cover
- **Tip:** Clear, descriptive titles
- **Placeholders:** 
  - Title: "Bridge to Basics: A Remedial Literacy RCT in Malawian Primary Schools"
  - PIs: Malawian university researchers
  - Partners: Ministry of Education, NGOs, District offices

#### Section 1: Problem & Policy Relevance
- **Tip:** Keep problem statement specific to one population and outcome
- **Examples:**
  - Problem: 55% of grade 4 students in Malawi read below grade level
  - Evidence gap: Lack of rigorous evidence on remedial instruction in low-resource settings
  - Beneficiaries: 3,200 students + teachers + policymakers
  - Policy priority: Ministry's 2024-2030 strategy, $15M allocation

#### Section 2: Theory of Change
- **Tip:** Draw tight lines from activities to outcomes; flag risky assumptions
- **Examples:**
  - Activities: Daily 45-min sessions, parent workshops, SMS tips
  - Outputs: 3,200 students attend 80% of sessions, 60 teachers trained
  - Short-run: 30 wpm reading fluency increase, parent involvement doubles
  - Long-run: 70% achieve grade-level proficiency, reduced dropout
  - Assumptions: 80% attendance (harvest season risk), teacher quality, parental literacy
  - Risks: Spillovers, seasonal attendance drops, teacher turnover

#### Section 3: Intervention & Implementation
- **Tip:** Provide enough detail for replication (who, what, when, where, how)
- **Examples:**
  - Description: "Bridge to Basics" program details
  - Components: Small-group instruction, teacher training, parent SMS, materials
  - Channels: In-person, SMS platform, mobile assessment
  - Frequency: Daily 45-min sessions, 5 days/week for 12 months
  - Eligibility: Grade 4, <60 wpm, attendance criteria
  - Implementers: Government, NGO, facilitators, principals
  - Constraints: Space, electricity, exam periods, budget limits

#### Section 4: Study Population & Sampling
- **Tip:** If spillovers feel unavoidable, use cluster-level assignment
- **Examples:**
  - Unit: Individual students (to minimize spillovers)
  - Frame: EMIS database cross-validated with registers
  - Inclusion/Exclusion: Ages 9-11, <60 wpm, attendance >80%
  - Coverage: 40 of 120 schools, semi-urban focus, accessibility limits

#### Section 5: Outcomes & Measurement
- **Tip:** If indicator feels fuzzy, add definition; prioritize measurable outcomes
- **Examples:**
  - Primary: Reading fluency (wpm), comprehension (0-100), grade progression
  - Secondary: Attendance, parent engagement, student confidence, teacher practices
  - Instruments: EGRA test, comprehension quiz, registers, parent survey
  - Indices: Overall literacy z-score, engagement index, fidelity index
  - Qualitative: Focus groups, teacher interviews, observation protocol

#### Section 8: Data Collection Plan
- **Tip:** Build in quality checks early; catch issues within 24 hours
- **Examples:**
  - Schedule: Baseline (Jan), Midline (Jun), Endline (Nov), 2-week windows
  - Training: 5-day program, 90% inter-rater reliability requirement
  - Tracking: 3 phone contacts, 48-hour follow-up, exit interviews
  - QC: Daily automated checks, 10% audit, 5% back-checks, HFC dashboard

#### Section 10: Ethics, Risks & Approvals
- **Tip:** Assign lead person to each risk; protect participants
- **Examples:**
  - Consent: Information sessions, written forms, local language, witnessed thumb prints
  - Adverse events: 24-hour reporting, safeguarding protocols, referral pathways
  - Privacy: Encryption, ID system, limited access, separate storage, 7-year retention

## Real-World Context Examples Used

### Education Sector (Primary Example)
- **Program:** Bridge to Basics remedial literacy
- **Location:** Malawi, 40 schools, 3 districts
- **Target:** 3,200 grade 4 below-level readers
- **Intervention:** Small-group instruction + parent engagement
- **Budget:** $180k
- **Timeline:** 12 months

### Health Sector (Secondary Example)
- **Program:** Community Care Loop maternal health
- **Target:** 6,400 mothers, postpartum visits
- **Intervention:** Home visits + IVR check-ins
- **Budget:** $240k
- **Challenge:** 30% drop in visit completion

### Agriculture Sector (Secondary Example)
- **Program:** Smart Water Boost irrigation
- **Target:** 2,100 smallholder farmers
- **Intervention:** Drip kits + soil sensors + SMS advisory
- **Budget:** $310k
- **Challenge:** Erratic rainfall, rising costs

## Placeholder Text Pattern

All placeholder text follows this structure:
1. **Specific and realistic:** Based on actual development programs
2. **Actionable:** Shows what good answers look like
3. **Contextual:** Includes numbers, locations, stakeholders
4. **Implementation-focused:** Addresses practical challenges

## Design Principles

1. **Self-guided:** Users can complete the wizard without external help
2. **Learning-oriented:** Examples teach good practice
3. **Context-appropriate:** Social development sector focus
4. **Implementation-realistic:** Acknowledges constraints and challenges

## Impact

Users now have:
- **Clear guidance** at every step
- **Realistic examples** from actual development contexts
- **Practical tips** from experienced researchers
- **Self-service capability** for creating concept notes

## Next Steps (If Needed)

- Add more sector-specific examples (infrastructure, governance, etc.)
- Include tips for common pitfalls in each section
- Add "coaching prompts" for facilitators (from old design)
- Include decision triggers and stakeholder briefing examples in Section 6
